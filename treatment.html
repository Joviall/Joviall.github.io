            <div class="content">
                <P>It contains six core processes:</P>
                <p><b>Acceptance</b> involves acknowledging and embracing the full range of your thoughts and emotions rather than trying to avoid, deny, or alter them.</p>
                <p><b>Cognitive defusion</b> involves distancing yourself from and changing the way you react to distressing thoughts and feelings, which will mitigate their harmful effects. </p>
                <p><b>Being present</b> involves being mindful in the present moment and observing your thoughts and feelings without judging them or trying to change them.</p>
                <p><b>Self as context</b> is an idea that expands the notion of self and identity.</p>
                <p><b>Values</b> encompass choosing personal values in different domains and striving to live according to those principles.</p>
                <p><b>Committed action</b> involves taking concrete steps to incorporate changes that will align with your values and lead to positive change. </p>

            <label for="toggle2" class="treatment-title"><b>Method 2. Morita Therapy</b></label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>There are three principles that we can follow:</p>
                <P><b>Nervousness and Fear Reflect Desire for Better Life:</b> Morita therapy recommends that we accept anxiety as a natural state of being and not be excessive in our efforts to control it. Stress is a reflection of our desire to have a meaningful life. </P>
                <p><b>Don't Try to Control Natural Emotions:</b> By developing the capacity to recognise and live with our natural inner states, we are better equipped to respond to life's challenges in a naturally healthy way. </p>
                <p><b>Take Productive Actions Regardless of How We Feel:</b> The best way to manage anxiety is to engage in activities of interest or focus on accomplishing the tasks on hand. As we do this, our thoughts will shift from self-preoccupation to meaning-making.</p>
