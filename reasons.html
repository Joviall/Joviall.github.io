        <h1>Why do you always feel anxious?</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="circle" id="circle1">Perhaps you're prone to anxiety, constantly overthinking whenever you tackle important or urgent tasks...</div>
        <div class="circle" id="circle2">Perhaps you're introverted, easily affected by social anxiety. You struggle with managing interpersonal relationships...</div>
        <div class="circle" id="circle3">You might be a highly sensitive person, who, in an overwhelming environment, is acutely aware of external stimuli, making you susceptible to anxious feelings...</div>

    <p class="text-bottom">Anxiety is often associated with "prevention orientation" and "promotion orientation." Prevention orientation focuses on avoiding negative outcomes, while promotion orientation aims to seize new opportunities and achievements.</p>
    <p class="text-bottom">People generally possess both traits, desiring to avoid mistakes while eager to try new things. However, failing to balance these aspects can lead to hesitation and draw one into a vortex of anxiety. For instance, you may want to share your hobbies at a freshman orientation to find like-minded friends, but the fear of embarrassment or not finding anyone can leave you caught in a cycle of self-doubt.</p>
