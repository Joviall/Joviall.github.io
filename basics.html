        <h2>What is Anxiety</h2>
        <p>Anxiety is when you feel scared, worried or panicky about something. It's a normal, human feeling and your body's natural response to stress or danger. Anyone can experience anxiety, regardless of age, gender, race, culture or faith.</p>
        <p>We all feel anxious from time to time. But the feeling usually passes once we feel safe or solve the problem that was causing the anxiety.</p>

        <P>2. <b>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):</b> OCD is characterized by recurring and unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and/or unwanted repetitive behaviors (compulsions).
